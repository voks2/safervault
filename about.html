              <p>The SaferVault project began in 2020 when Vojin Mitrović, a Web Manager at the Slavko Ćuruvija Foundation, envisioned a tool to help investigative journalists protect their data in situations where they might be forced or threatened to relinquish access to their recording devices.</p>
              <p>Vojin successfully raised funds to develop a proof-of-concept application called <strong>Safer Recorder</strong>. This system consisted of two parts: an Android voice recorder app for journalists in the field and a web platform controlled by editors in the office. Journalists could record audio, which was encrypted in real-time and transferred to the web platform, allowing editors to access the recordings. The key innovation was that journalists could capture information without being able to play it back, making it inaccessible to potential attackers who might force them to surrender their devices.</p>
              <p>Technically, this was achieved by encrypting the data with a key held by another entity rather than the recording system itself. Crucially, no readable data was ever stored on the device, preventing attackers from retrieving information through device forensics.</p>
              <p>Check out the screenshots of the Safer Recorder web platform and mobile app below to see how the initial concept took shape:</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Building on this success, Vojin expanded the concept into a more comprehensive data capture and management solution, simplifying the design and addressing security concerns. This evolution led to the creation of <strong>SaferVault</strong>, which integrates camera and file management capabilities alongside sound recording.</p>
              <p>Unlike the previous version, SaferVault eliminates the need for a centralized server, reducing security risks and enhancing development opportunities. With innovative mobile app <a href="/index.html#features">features</a> like compartmentalized encryption, encrypted data export-import, and Guard Mode, SaferVault offers flexibility and robust protection against a broader range of safety risks and scenarios.</p>

              <p>While SaferVault offers robust features for protecting data, it’s important to acknowledge its limitations when facing the most formidable threats. As explained in the <a href="index.html#guard-mode">Guard mode</a> feature description, SaferVault allows users to capture data that can only be decrypted by the trusted individual who pre-authorized the Guard mode instance. In most cases, this is sufficient to prevent data loss, as that individual remains out of reach from the attacker. However, when dealing with powerful entities that can exert immense pressure—such as security services, international corporations, or global organizations—the risk extends beyond simply accessing your data. These actors may compel the user to reveal the identity of the person who holds the decryption credentials. Once this identity is exposed, they could trace and coerce that individual into providing access to the encrypted information.</p>
              <p>SaferVault currently lacks a technical solution to fully conceal the identity of the decryption authority in these extreme scenarios. While practical workarounds exist, such as using pre-authorized devices within an organization, these approaches require significant coordination and further testing.</p>
              <p>Our current solution effectively addresses common security needs, but we recognize that further innovation is essential to protect against the highest-stakes threats. We welcome collaboration and partnerships to develop and refine solutions that can better safeguard against these extreme scenarios.</p>

              <p>The SaferVault concept has advanced to a stage where user flows for all key features have been translated into wireframes for the mobile app, as explained on this website. The core technical concept, such as ensuring encryption without storing readable data on the device, has been validated through a proof-of-concept application. Additionally, comprehensive product documentation and preliminary market analysis, including competition research, have been completed.</p>
              <p>The next step is to validate the mobile app concept through real-world testing, refining the design and user experience based on thorough feedback and risk analysis. <strong>To achieve this, we are seeking partnerships with developers specializing in digital security, as well as experts in risk management and encryption. Their collaboration will help us iron-out the application design, ensuring that the mockups are ready for presentation to target audiences for feedback and validation.</strong></p>
              <p>This process is crucial to ensure that the app meets the needs of users in high-risk scenarios and delivers on its promise of data security.</p>
              <p>For more complex scenarios involving powerful entities capable of reaching individuals globally, further innovation is required. The challenge lies in developing a system that can conceal the identity of the trusted individual while preserving the user's ability to regain access to their data once the threat has subsided. This may involve creating a unique platform anonymizer or developing a specialized file transfer protocol to achieve this goal.</p>

              <p>SaferVault was conceived by Vojin Mitrović, a web manager and content editor from Belgrade, Serbia, with extensive experience in managing content platforms and initiatives within the nonprofit sector, focusing on human rights, legal, and media projects. For more details, visit Vojin's <a href="https://voks2.github.io/" target="_blank">personal website</a>.</p>
              <p>The Safer Recorder proof-of-concept application, which preceded SaferVault, was also developed under Vojin's vision. This project was funded by Internews and brought to life by Aleksandar Acić, an Android developer based in Berlin, Germany.</p>
