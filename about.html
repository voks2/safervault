              <p>The SaferVault project began in 2020 when Vojin Mitrović, a Web Manager at the Slavko Ćuruvija Foundation, envisioned a tool to help journalists safeguard their data in situations when they are forced or threatened to give up access to their recording devices.</p>
              <p>Vojin successfully raised funds to develop an open-source proof-of-concept application called Safer Recorder. It was a two-part system: an Android sound recorder app, and a web platform. Journalists would record audio, which was then encrypted in near-real time and transferred to the web platform, where the editors could consume the recordings. The point of the system was that journalists could only record data and not play it back, thus making it inaccessible to the attackers, even if they were put under duress.</p>
              <p>From a technical standpoint, the Safer Recorder also demonstrated that recordings could be encrypted so that no readable data was ever stored on the device. This was important as it potentially prevented aggressive actors from retrieving information even after deletion.</p>
              <p>Building on this success, Vojin decided to evolve the concept into a more comprehensive data capture and management solution, while simplifying the design and reducing security concerns. This led to the creation of SaferVault, which adds camera and file management capabilities alongside sound recording.</p>
              <p>Unlike the previous version, SaferVault eliminates the need for a centralized server, reducing security risks and new features, such as encrypted data export-import and Guard Mode, offer greater flexibility and protection against a broader range of safety risks and scenarios.</p>

              <p>While SaferVault offers robust features for protecting data, it’s important to acknowledge its limitations when facing the most formidable threats. As explained in the Guard Mode feature description, SaferVault allows users to capture data that can only be decrypted by the trusted individual who pre-authorized the Guard Mode instance. In most cases, this is sufficient to prevent data loss, as that individual remains out of reach from the attacker. However, when dealing with powerful entities that can exert immense pressure—such as security services, international corporations, or global organizations—the risk extends beyond simply accessing your data. These actors may compel you to reveal the identity of the person who holds the decryption credentials. Once this identity is exposed, they could trace and coerce that individual into providing access to your encrypted information.</p>
              <p>SaferVault currently lacks a technical solution to fully conceal the identity of the decryption authority in these extreme scenarios. While practical workarounds exist, such as using pre-authorized devices within an organization, these approaches require significant coordination and further testing.</p>
              <p>Our current solution effectively addresses common security needs, but we recognize that further innovation is essential to protect against the highest-stakes threats. We welcome collaboration and partnerships to develop and refine solutions that can better safeguard against these extreme scenarios.</p>

              <p>The SaferVault concept has advanced to a stage where user flows for all key features have been translated into wireframes for the mobile app, as explained on this website. The core technical concept, such as ensuring encryption without storing readable data on the device, has been validated through a proof-of-concept application. Additionally, comprehensive product documentation and preliminary market analysis, including competition research, have been completed.</p>
              <p>The next step is to validate the mobile app concept through real-world testing, iterating on the design and user experience based on detailed feedback and risk analysis. This process is crucial to ensure that the app meets the needs of users in high-risk scenarios and delivers on its promise of data security. </p>
              <p>For more complex scenarios involving powerful entities capable of reaching individuals globally, further innovation is required. The challenge lies in developing a system that can conceal the identity of the trusted individual while preserving the user's ability to regain access to their data once the threat has subsided. This may involve creating a unique platform anonymizer or developing a specialized file transfer protocol to achieve this goal.</p>

              <p>SaferVault was conceived by Vojin Mitrović, a web manager and content editor from Belgrade, Serbia, with extensive experience in managing content platforms and initiatives within the nonprofit sector, focusing on human rights, legal, and media projects. For more details, visit Vojin's <a href="https://voks2.github.io/" target="_blank">personal website</a>.</p>
              <p>The SaferRecorder proof-of-concept application, which preceded SaferVault, was also developed under Vojin's vision. This project was funded by Internews and brought to life by Aleksandar Acić, an Android developer based in Berlin, Germany.</p>
