            <div class="section-sub-title">Problem</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>Data security has long been compromised by a fundamental issue: when someone is forced to reveal their password or security credentials, the entire system is at risk. This vulnerability, rooted in the reliance on individuals to safeguard their passwords or activate biometric safety mechanisms, remains unresolved with current solutions. Despite technological advances, these barriers can be breached under pressure, whether through threats, manipulation, or brute force. Current market solutions still need to address this critical problem, leaving a significant gap in secure data protection.</p></div>
          </div> 
          <div class="sub-section">
            <div class="section-sub-title">Solution</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>We propose a system that fundamentally changes how data is recorded, captured, and stored by allowing the user to transfer the unlocking mechanism to a trusted third party. This deliberate transfer means the user deprives themselves of the capacity to unlock the safety mechanism, effectively eliminating the possibility of granting access under duress. By separating access control entirely from the user's capabilities—whether through personal knowledge or biometric methods like fingerprint or eye scan recognition—this approach offers a robust solution for safeguarding sensitive information.</p></div>
          </div> 
          <div class="sub-section">
            <div class="section-sub-title">Product</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>While the proposed solution is applicable to securing data across various systems and industries, we have distilled this concept into a highly evolved mobile app featuring versatile, all-in-one capabilities as a recorder, camera, and file manager. The SaferVault concept builds on the core solution and enables users to protect their data from a wide range of risks. Users can manage their own secure recording environments, back up and share encrypted data, and address threats across various extreme scenarios. Finally, the app’s streamlined, mobile-only design, which eliminates the need for a centralized server, facilitates rapid development and deployment while providing ease of use with minimal components to safeguard and maintain.</p>

            <div class="section-sub-title">Instance-based encryption</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>SaferVault enables users to create multiple recording instances, each safeguarded by a unique password. This feature ensures that the data collected within a specific instance is encrypted and accessible only through the corresponding password, ensuring that all recordings tied to other passwords remain hidden.</p>
            <p>This compartmentalization offers flexibility across various scenarios, whether the user needs to protect sensitive business information, personal recordings, or crucial evidence in extreme situations. For instance, if a user is under duress, they can provide access to a less critical recording while keeping more sensitive data safely concealed.</p></div>
          </div> 
          <div class="sub-section">
            <div class="section-sub-title">Encrypted export & import</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>From within SaferVault instances, users can export recordings and files as ordinary TXT files that contain encrypted data. On their own, these files are worthless, but they can be imported back into the same SaferVault installation and decrypted using the original password, within the same instance where they were created. Additionally, they can be sent to a different device, imported into SaferVault, and decrypted using the same password.</p>
            <p>This feature provides great flexibility in risk-averse situations. Users can back up their encrypted data to the cloud or share it securely with others. Once the recipient retrieves the encrypted file and is made aware of the password (send via secure messaging apps, like Signal), they can import it into their SaferVault app and access its content.</p></div>

          <div class="sub-section">
            <div class="section-sub-title" id="guard-mode">Guard mode</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>The Guard Mode is a special instance which is designed for high-risk situations where users may be forced or pressured to reveal access to their recordings or files. This mode allows users to capture information without the ability to access it themselves, preventing the attacker from obtaining access to the data through the user.</p>
              <p>Unlike a regular instance, the Guard Mode instance requires pre-authorization by another individual. Once set up, the user can record or capture data without knowing the password, ensuring the recorded information is encrypted and stored securely on the device. Although the data can be exported as a TXT file, it remains inaccessible to the user (and attacker) without the third party’s involvement.</p>

        <div class="sub-section-container">
          <div class="sub-section">
            <div class="section-sub-title">1. Let someone else enter the password to activate the Guard mode</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>In high-risk scenarios where users may expect to be pressured to reveal sensitive information—such as when traveling through hostile environments, interviewing sensitive witnesses, or dealing with authorities who may demand access to devices—not having access to their own data can be a strategic advantage. The first step is for a trusted individual to authorize a Guard Mode Instance in the user’s SaferVault installation by entering a password that the user deliberately does not know. This is done physically, either by the user handing the device to the trusted individual or by the user taking possession of the already authorized device.</p></div>
          </div> 
          <div class="sub-section">
            <div class="section-sub-title">2. Use the Guard mode to record sensitive Information</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>With a Guard Mode Instance that is primed and ready, all recorded data is encrypted using a password unknown to the user. Even if an attacker attempts to force access to the information, their efforts will be futile, as the user cannot access the data themselves. This circumstance also creates a practical deterrent, discouraging the attacker from applying further force, recognizing it as a pointless effort.</p></div>
          </div> 
          <div class="sub-section">
            <div class="section-sub-title">3. Access recorded information through the person who knows the password</div>
            <div class="section-text"><p>Once the danger has passed, the user can contact the person who knows the password to regain access to their recordings and files. Although the user cannot view the content within the Guard Mode Instance, they can list, rename, and export items as encrypted TXT files, just as in a regular SaferVault instance. These files can then be sent to the person who authorized the instance for decryption, or the password can be securely sent back to the user (via Signal, for example). With the password, the user can convert the Guard Mode Instance back into a regular one, allowing them to access and consume the information on their device.</p>
